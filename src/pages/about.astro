    <p>
      I am Hendrik Jungnitsch, based in Bielefeld, a city in Germany. I got into the hobby in
      2020 and split my time between astrophotography and visual observing.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.9rem;">
      Most of my imaging happens from my Bortle 5 backyard. I do not limit myself to
      one target class. Anything that is practical and worthwhile from my location is
      fair game.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.9rem;">
      Visual observing is the most fun for me, even though light pollution sets limits.
      My favorites are solar-system objects, brighter nebulae with an OIII filter, and
      globular clusters.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.9rem;">
      I use both reflectors and refractors. For photography I usually prefer refractors
      for simplicity and clean, spike-free stars. For visual sessions I like using a
      manual Dobson.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.9rem;">
      In processing I aim for a natural look. I am still learning and refining my own
      style, but I generally avoid images that feel strongly overprocessed.
