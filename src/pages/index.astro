      Astrophotography from my backyard in Bielefeld, Germany.<br/>
      Since 2020, I’ve been capturing whatever the night sky offers, from the Sun and planets to distant nebulae, galaxies, and globular clusters.
      <br/>
      This site is a growing collection of my deep-sky and solar system work, including capture details and dedicated object pages.
