      Backyard astrophotography from Bielefeld, Germany. Since 2020 I have
      been photographing and observing whatever the sky allows from planets and the Sun
      to nebulae, galaxies and globular clusters.
      On this site you will find a growing collection of my deep-sky and solar-system images with capture details and object pages.
